## Presentation

XSS type injections are possible from eonweb, the injection parameters are the "Job Name" and "Job Description" fields. A user with permissions to access the export or autodiscovery can execute javascript code for example on the eonweb interface. This flaw therefore requires authentication and is more conducive to a fishing attack. It therefore does not present a significant danger.
